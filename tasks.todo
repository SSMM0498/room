### **Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (Core Pages & Auth)**

#### **Part A: Define Project Structure (Files & Layouts)**

* [x] **Task 1: Create Layout Files**
    * [x] Create the following files inside the `layouts/` directory:
        * [x] `auth.vue`: A minimal layout for login/signup pages, typically just a centered content area.
        * [x] `default.vue`: For standard pages with a header and footer (e.g., Landing, Courses).
        * [x] `ide.vue`: A full-screen, distraction-free layout for the main recorder/replayer interface.
        * [x] `content.vue`: A layout for static content pages (like "About Us," "Terms") if you plan to use Nuxt Content.

* [ ] **Task 2: Create Page Files**
    * [ ] Create the following files and folders inside the `pages/` directory:
        * [x] `index.vue` (The Landing Page)
        * [x] `login.vue` (The User Login Page)
        * [x] `register.vue` (The User Registration Page)
        * [ ] `profile.vue` (The User's Profile Page)
        * [ ] `courses/`
            * [ ] `index.vue` (The Course Listing Page)
            * [ ] `[id].vue` (The Course Detail Page)
        * [ ] `learn/`
            * [ ] `[id].vue` (The main Learning/Replayer Page)

#### **Part B: Implement Core Authentication Logic**

* [ ] **Task 3: Create a Central Authentication Composable**
    * [x] In the `composables/` directory, create a new file (e.g., `useAuth.ts`, `useAuthUser.ts`).
    * [x] Define the state within this composable to hold the current user's data and a boolean for their logged-in status.
    * [x] Define functions for `login`, `signup`, `logout`, and `fetchUser`, which will interact with the PocketBase SDK.
    * [ ] Define a function to handle OAuth logins (Google, GitHub).

* [x] **Task 4: Create a Global Authentication Plugin**
    * [x] In the `plugins/` directory, create a file (e.g., `auth.server.ts`).
    * [x] This plugin will run once when the app loads on the client.
    * [x] Its purpose is to check the request cookies for a valid PocketBase auth token and load the user into the `useAuth` composable state. This ensures a user remains logged in when they refresh the page.

* [ ] **Task 5: Create Authentication Middleware**
    * [x] In the `middleware/` directory, create a file (e.g., `auth.ts` `guest.ts`).
    * [x] This middleware will protect specific routes.
    * [x] It should check the user's authentication status from the `useAuth` composable.
    * [ ] If the user is not logged in and tries to access a protected page (like `/profile`), it should redirect them to the `/login` page.

#### **Part C: Build Pages and Integrate Logic**

* [ ] **Task 6: Implement Layouts and Static Pages**
    * [x] Build the basic structure of the four layouts (`default`, `auth`, `ide`, `content`) with placeholder components for headers/footers and a `<slot />` for page content.
    * [ ] Build the static **Landing Page** (`index.vue`), applying the `default` layout.

* [x] **Task 7: Implement Authentication Pages**
    * [x] Build the **Login Page** (`login.vue`).
        * [x] Apply the `auth` layout.
        * [x] Create the login form (email, password) and buttons for OAuth providers.
        * [x] Connect the form submission to the `login` function in your `useAuth` composable.
        * [x] Handle successful login by redirecting to the profile or dashboard page.
    * [x] Build the **Signup Page** (`signup.vue`).
        * [x] Apply the `auth` layout.
        * [x] Create the registration form.
        * [x] Connect the form submission to the `signup` function in your `useAuth` composable.

* [ ] **Task 8: Implement Public Course Pages**
    * [x] Build the **Courses Listing Page** (`courses/index.vue`).
        * [x] Apply the `default` layout.
        * [x] Use a server route to fetch all `published` records from your `courses` collection in PocketBase.
        * [x] Display the list of courses.
    * [ ] Build the **Course Detail Page** (`courses/[id].vue`).
        * [ ] Apply the `default` layout.
        * [ ] Use the route parameter (`id`) to fetch the specific course's data from PocketBase.
        * [ ] Display the course title, description, author, tags, etc.

* [ ] **Task 9: Implement the Protected Profile Page**
    * [ ] Build the **Profile Page** (`profile.vue`).
        * [ ] Apply the `default` layout.
        * [ ] Assign the `auth` middleware to this page to protect it.
        * [ ] Display the logged-in user's information (name, email, avatar) by accessing the state from the `useAuth` composable.
        * [ ] Include a "Logout" button that calls the `logout` function.
